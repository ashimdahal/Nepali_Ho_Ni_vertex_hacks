Ok, now lets get to the point.

# Introduction to Project Name
Our health-based web app is a response to the dire need for improved healthcare in remote villages of Nepal. Despite living in a beautiful country, many people in these remote locations struggle to access the basic healthcare they need to maintain their health and well-being. This is a problem that we aim to address with our app.


# What problems are we solving?

1. <b>Mental Health Probelms: </b>
An important aspect of the app is its emphasis on mental health. The app includes a feature that connects users with a chatbot for mental health support that can speak in `Romanized Nepali`. This chatbot is designed to provide support, and help for managing mental health in a convenient, accessible, and anonymous way. This feature is not only beneficial for people living in remote villages of Nepal but also for anyone who may have difficulty accessing mental health resources or are more comfortable communicating in Romanized Nepali. Users can interact with the chatbot at any time and receive a constant support system that listens to them and replies accordingly.

2. <b>Disease Detection System:</b>
 One of the key features of the app is the diabetes detection tool, which uses advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze user input and provide an accurate assessment of the user's risk for diabetes. Similarly, the app also includes a skin disease detection feature, which allows users to upload images of any suspicious skin changes and receive a diagnosis within minutes. This makes it possible for individuals living in remote villages to access accurate health assessments without having to travel long distances or incur high costs.


3. <b>Locating Doctors: </b>
In addition to these features, the app also includes a location-based search function that helps users find nearby doctors based on their current geolocation. This feature provides users with a list of doctors in their area, along with their contact information and distance from the user's location. This feature makes it easy for users to find the closest and most convenient healthcare providers, even in the most remote and hard-to-reach areas.

# What we believe our project will do?
Our health-based web app is a powerful tool for improving health outcomes and empowering individuals living in remote villages of Nepal. By providing easy access to diabetes and skin disease detection tools, mental health resources, and nearby healthcare providers, the app is designed to address the healthcare disparities faced by people in remote locations of Nepal and empower them to take control of their health and make informed decisions about their care.

# Is our app about Healthcare then?
Our web-app is not only about healthcare but about `Accessibility` in `Healthcare`.
